Developing a strong and well-adapted sense of wellbeing can help individuals overcome difficulties and achieve their goals. It also has important social benefits, improving educational attainment, economic productivity, social and family relationships, social cohesion, and overall quality of life.</p>

      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>This project involves the development of a web application that will enable users to find information about wellbeing and set themselves goals to help enhance their sense of wellbeing. Wellbeing is subjective and will be different for different people, so it is important that the application allows individuals to set their own goals. It is also important that users know that the application will secure their data and ensure their privacy.</p>
      <h3>Features</h3>
      <p>The application should allow the users to do the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Anyone should be able to browse to the site and view an About Us page with information about the application.</li>
        <li>Individuals should be able to register for the application.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Registered users should be able to login and:</li>
          <li>view information about nutrition, fitness, and a healthy lifestyle.</li>
          <li>define a series of personal goals in each category (nutrition, fitness, healthy lifestyle).</li>
          <li>add, remove, and modify their own personal goals for several weeks ahead.</li>
          <li>record the achievement of their own personal goals when they occur (e.g. goals can be ticked off or actual times or number of repetitions can be recorded).</li>
          <li>review a history of their own personal achievements.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

      <h2>Development Tools</h2>
      <p>The application should be developed using Node.js and Express with NeDB used to store information. It is expected that Mustache templates will be used, however another approach to developing the user interface would be acceptable if appropriate justification is provided.</p>
